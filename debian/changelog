rubygems-integration (1.10) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix overlay incompatibility starting with Ruby 2.1.
    Thanks to Gustavo Machado Campagnani Gama <nsn.igenesis@gmail.com>
    (Closes: #783972)
  * Stop installing compatibility symlink for ruby2.0

rubygems-integration (1.9) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Include /usr/lib/$(triplet)/rubygems-integration/$(api_version) in the
    Rubygems path. This might be used in the future to make Ruby packages
    support multiarch.
  * debian/tests/control: run specs against installed package.
  * Add workaround for Ruby 2.2 because gem2deb < 0.18.2 installed
    gemspecs to directories named after the short Ruby version (2.2) instead
    of the API_VERSION (2.2.0). There was already a similar workaround for
    Ruby 2.1, so this should have been fixed a long time ago.

rubygems-integration (1.8) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Antonio Terceiro ]
  * Improve smoke tests in debian/tests/package-list.
    .
    Test a gem that comes together with the interpreter, one arch:all and one
    arch:any

  [ Christian Hofstaedtler ]
  * Add myself to Uploaders
  * Advise rubygems to load SSL certificates from the ca-certificates
    provided list. (Closes: #689074)

rubygems-integration (1.7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Drop dependency on Ruby, since the interpreters now actually depend on
    this package.
  * Add workaround for loading ruby2.1-specific gemspecs from wrong path used
    by gem2deb (Closes: #746470)
    .
    The definitive fix belongs in gem2deb and is making it install the
    gemspecs to the correct place so that rubygems-integration does not have
    to be changed again when the next version comes.

rubygems-integration (1.6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add support for disabling rubygems-integration by setting an environment
    variable DEBIAN_DISABLE_RUBYGEMS_INTEGRATION.

 -- Antonio Terceiro <terceiro@debian.org>  Thu, 10 Apr 2014 16:47:15 -0300

rubygems-integration (1.5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add /usr/share/rubygems-integration/all to the gem path.
    This will allow installing a single gemspec for `Architecture: all`
    packages that will work with every interpreter, and won't require a new
    upload when a new interpreter comes along.
